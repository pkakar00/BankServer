# Hotel-Server
This is a Hotel backend server created as a part of class project. 
The project uses multithreading to handle requests from multiple clients. The server can do reserve, delete bookings and update username.
The functionality of the server is limited to these features as my overall focus was to utilize the concept of multi-threading. All the methods of
Hotel class are synchronised to avoid any types of conflicts. The client to server over a network and then the requests are made.
Feel free to add new features, and provide your feedback. I am a computer science student and I am currently learning these concepts.
